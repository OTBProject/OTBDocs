## Commands

Commands are words which the bot will respond to if they are the first word in a message. Commands often start with an exclamation mark, such as `!example`, but they can be any string of characters without a space in them. Some commands can tell the bot to perform an action, instead of just printing a message in response; these are known as "script commands".
