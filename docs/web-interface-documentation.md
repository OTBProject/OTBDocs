## Opening
### On the local machine
If you are trying to open the web interface on the machine that the bot is running on, providing that you have the GUI open, there is a button to open the web interface in the default web browser.
If you do not have the GUI open, or want to open it in a different browser, you can navigate to <a href="http://localhost:22222" target="_blank">http://localhost:22222</a> by default to view a read only version and <a href="http://127.0.0.1:22222" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:22222</a> by default to view the writable version.
